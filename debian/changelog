  [ apprb ]
  * proper encrypted history loading
  * encrypted history: class constructor: refacroring
  * Fixes

  [ dubslow ]
  * move encryption to separate file for sanity
  * core encryption file is basically complete, I need to verify privacy tab
  * incremental
  * Incremental work, starting to take shape
  * Ah, much cleaner
  * Added change pw buttons; encryption is very nearly done. @apprb there is
    one question and one TODO that you should look over in privacyform.cpp, as
    well as a TODO in historykeeper.cpp Also both the encryption settings box
    and the pw dialog lineedits should probably be in a QGridLayout... but I
    don't really want to do that by hand :P

  [ Dubslow ]
  * Clarification
  * fix copyright statement, update comment
  * Fix not setting tox null after cleanup also reordered functions for super
    extra safety

  [ apprb ]
  * history: encrypted <-> plain convertion
  * small code unification

  [ Dubslow ]
  * finishing touches

  * plain db encryption

  [ Dubslow ]
  * just remove clearing password in dtor which is only called on exit solves
    the bug found by apprb
  * turns out the password code saving Configuration was useless anyways would
    have avoided the bug I just "fixed"
  * warn only once on unecrypted file with encryption set
  * Fix threading issue with startup pw popup The GUI is slow to update after
    accepting a password, but a cursory ten minute investigation didn't yield
    why I inserted a processEvents() call before ready = true; at the end of
    Core::start, but that didn't help. Define the total time between the
    password dialog disappearing and the UI updating with your own status is
    T: Then my debug statement indicated that this processEvents call happened
    around 1/3T, raising two questions: 1) What the hell is happening between
    0 and 1/3 T? Decryption doesn't take that long... Note that bad passwords
    are immediately rejected with a new dialog, so I highly doubt it's the
    decryption cpu time 2) The remaining 2/3rds: processEvents has been called
    after the avatar and username signals, yet they don't update in the UI
    till time T when everything updates after bootstrapping...
  * remove files that I shouldn't have added in the first place
  * tweak to popup questions
  * fix change profiles button
  * Move privacy tab settings to per-profile settings file This may lose the
    current settings in the tab, but currently only keep history is enabled
    anyways
  * word wrap the privacy tab string

  * refactor/fix switching profile with separate settings

  * when loading, try using main password for history
  * fix clearing duplicate passwords fixes dubslow/qTox#2
  * fix loading an encrypted chat log failing
  * fix bug with "use other password" It's more trouble than it's worth to
    shallow copy; changed to deep copy with STL
  * Improve dialogs around unencrypting history, per zetok's suggestions
  * Ignore empty history files on start This fixes an esoteric issue of
    enabling chat log encryption and then restarting before adding any
    messages
  * Slightly more useful initial password dialogs
  * Fix profile settings issue from command line, default unencrypt history is Cancel
  * Fix segfault, minor cleanup
  * Fix bug with initial password dialogs accepting empty passwords
  * Confirm decrypt data, various ui/txt tweaks
  * oops, fortunately this wasn't a bug yet...

  * Fix two minor bugs
  * Fix threading issue while widget's killing itself
  * fix button typo, closes dubslow/qTox#7
  * write settings *after* changing them... closes dubslow/qTox#3
  * Hacky fix to cancelling a switch to an encrypted profile closing It's
    either this or some fairly major refactoring, which is preferable, but
    I've got another even bigger refactoring in mind, and fixing this will be
    rolled into that. Closes dubslow/qTox#4

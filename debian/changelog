  * This dialog solves all confusion that arose from current verification
    method and is accident-proof. Current method asks if user also wants to
    remove chat history. However confused user may not carefully read message
    and click "no" because he does not want to remve contact. However in this
    case contact is in fact removed but history is preserved. It is also open
    to possiblity that key smashing deletes contact by accident. This is very
    inconvenient because tox ids are long and hard to memorize. If someone
    removes contact by accident then he would need to find id of that contact
    in order to contact him/her. Sometimes this may be difficult.

  * core encryption file is basically complete, I need to verify privacy tab
  * incremental
  * Incremental work, starting to take shape
  * Ah, much cleaner
  * Added change pw buttons; encryption is very nearly done. @apprb there is
    one question and one TODO that you should look over in privacyform.cpp, as
    well as a TODO in historykeeper.cpp Also both the encryption settings box
    and the pw dialog lineedits should probably be in a QGridLayout... but I
    don't really want to do that by hand :P

  * just remove clearing password in dtor which is only called on exit solves
    the bug found by apprb
  * turns out the password code saving Configuration was useless anyways would
    have avoided the bug I just "fixed"
  * warn only once on unecrypted file with encryption set
  * Fix threading issue with startup pw popup The GUI is slow to update after
    accepting a password, but a cursory ten minute investigation didn't yield
    why I inserted a processEvents() call before ready = true; at the end of
    Core::start, but that didn't help. Define the total time between the
    password dialog disappearing and the UI updating with your own status is
    T: Then my debug statement indicated that this processEvents call happened
    around 1/3T, raising two questions: 1) What the hell is happening between
    0 and 1/3 T? Decryption doesn't take that long... Note that bad passwords
    are immediately rejected with a new dialog, so I highly doubt it's the
    decryption cpu time 2) The remaining 2/3rds: processEvents has been called
    after the avatar and username signals, yet they don't update in the UI
    till time T when everything updates after bootstrapping...
  * remove files that I shouldn't have added in the first place
  * tweak to popup questions

  * Basic infrastructure for profiles is in place, now I gotta hook up the UI
  * forgot a button, also the ui is fucked at default size (expand a few
    pixels and its fine though)
  * Profiles, with at least a few bugs: sanitizing file names isn't done,
    delete fails because of autosaves, and imports segfault for me

  [ Bill Winslow ]

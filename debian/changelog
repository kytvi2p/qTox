  * Basic infrastructure for profiles is in place, now I gotta hook up the UI
  * forgot a button, also the ui is fucked at default size (expand a few
    pixels and its fine though)
  * Profiles, with at least a few bugs: sanitizing file names isn't done,
    delete fails because of autosaves, and imports segfault for me

  [ Bill Winslow ]
  * incremental improvements to profiles, more work required
  * more incremental changes, nothing works yet (I just want to change
    branches)
  * more incremental commits, compiles and sort of works now
  * incremental, commiting in order to push

  [ Dubslow ]
  * oops
  * Fixed misusing tox_load; profiles are significantly less buggy
  * simplification
  * swapping profiles is now less buggy, but friends still don't come online

  [ dubslow ]
  * implement sanitize, one tweak
  * add startup profile detection
  * properly implement clearing contacts list
  * readd profiles ui
  * (Re)implement profiles UI, using some of the old code. Avatars aren't
    handled on switching, and also something about friends disappearing...
  * IT WORKS, IT FINALLY WORKS
  * tweaks
  * read tox_save if no data; if no profiles, no popup

  [ apprb ]
  * FileTransferWidget improvements
  * magic number removed in FileTransferInstance
